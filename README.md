[**Project 1: Gaming infographic**](https://github.com/vikramadityatatke96/Gaming-Infographic) <br>
For the purposes of this infographic we have selected the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/egrinstein/20-years-of-games/version/2. It consists of 18000 rows with corresponding to different titles and platforms from 1996 to 2016. For example, if a game title was released on 3 different platforms it is accommodated in 3 rows. For every title the dataset contains the release day, month and year specific to each platform the title was released on. Furthermore, a genre associated with the title along with a review score and score phrase given by the popular games reviewing website IGN has been included in the dataset. In addition to this, we can see whether a game was an editor’s choice or not. Having such a huge collection of data is extremely useful for not only generating infographics but also to perform data analysis. Well classified data is extremely suitable for creating visualizations, as we can easily extract the information from the source. This also makes it easier to identify trends and make comparisons. As this dataset contains time-series information forming a story, while emphasizing on key elements becomes straightforward, which is the fundamental aspect of an infographic.

[**Project 2: Exploring a century of olympic games**](https://github.com/vikramadityatatke96/Data-Visualisation---Exploring-a-Century-of-Olympic-Games) <br>
We have performed analysis on the Olympic Games held from 1896 to 2016. Through our analysis we will uncover various trends in the Olympic games and most noteworthy trends have been presented below in the form of intuitive images and graphs. The Olympic games have been in existence for over a century, which makes it interesting to discover the underlying patterns which can potentially describe the evolution of sports over time. Furthermore, such data can also point towards other social factors which may have developed or recessed since the 19th Century.

[**Project 3: Movie reccommendation system**](https://github.com/vikramadityatatke96/Basic-Movie-Recommendation-System)<br>
In recent years internet connectivity has evolved significantly making it possible to maintain big cloud storages even for the average consumers. This has led to the adoption of streaming services by the consumers. These days consumers are provided with a plethora of options. This has provoked the need to implement recommendation systems. But for new users recommendation engines cannot function due to the complete lack of user-specific data. Until the user data generated it is possible to provide generic recommendation based on the users around them or based on the current trends. This paper talks about such generic queries, which can help the existing recommendation systems to deal with new users. Through this project we have carried out experiments on the MovieLens dataset and discussed the results of data analysis. All of our results can be used to provide customers with initial recommendations. Our results are considerably trustworthy due to the sheer number of users who have provided ratings and tags to thousands of movies released in the past century.

[**Project 4: Steam Game Analysis**](https://github.com/vikramadityatatke96/Steam-Game-Analysis)<br>
Steam is the world's most popular PC Gaming hub. With a massive collection that includes everything from AAA blockbusters to small indie titles, great discovery tools can be super valuable for Steam. How can we make them better?
This dataset is a list of user behaviors, with columns: user-id, game-title, behavior-name, value. The behaviors included are 'purchase' and 'play'. The value indicates the degree to which the behavior was performed - in the case of 'purchase' the value is always 1, and in the case of 'play' the value represents the number of hours the user has played the game.

[**Project 5: Airline Data Warehouse**](https://github.com/vikramadityatatke96/Airline-Data-Warehouse)<br>
We have selected Austrian Airlines, Etihad Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways and Turkish Airlines for this study. In addition to that, it also shows the relation between the performance measures of the airlines with the sentiments of the passenger and their ratings. It takes into consideration the global traffic growth for 5 years and relates it with he total number of passengers carried by these airlines for these selected years. The following report tries to find a correlation between various airline measures and passenger ratings. First requirement ofourprojectwouldbe to analyze the influence of the total number of passengers carried by the major airline on the air traffic growth worldwide. Second requirement of our project would be to study the correlation between the travel satisfaction of the passengers and the class of the cabin by which they have travelled.


[**Project 6:Amazon Products Recommendation System**](https://github.com/vikramadityatatke96/Recomender-System-for-Amazon-Products)<br>
Online E-commerce websites like Amazon, Filpkart uses different recommendation models to provide different suggestions to different users. Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time. This type of filtering matches each of the user's purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list for the user. In this project we are going to build recommendation model for the electronics products of Amazon.

[**Project 7:Sarcasm Detection**](https://github.com/vikramadityatatke96/Sarcasm-Detection)<br>
Online reviews through social media and other platforms play a vital role in predicting the success of a product. They are helpful in understanding about the people’s opinion on a product. This is achieved by
performing sentiment analysis. However, the sentiment
scores cannot be completely relied on to get efficient results
because of the presence of sarcasm. Sarcasm has the ability
to shift a positive sentence into a negative one. Therefore,
it is vital to understand the impacts of sarcasm on a text.
In this research, we made use of news headlines data
set to train our LSTM models and deduct the sarcasm
on a text. This project uses CRISP-DM methodology for
implementing the project. The research model is based on
LSTM, Long short-term memory, which is an architecture
based on recurrent neural networks (RNN). As part of
this project several LSTM models were developed with
different parameter settings. Each model has a unique
setting and data holdout for training and testing the model.
Using these models, we have achieved an accuracy range
of 82.99 to 84.94 across the models.
Index Terms—RNN, LSTM, CRISP-DM, EDA, NLP.
